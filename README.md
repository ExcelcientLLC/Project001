Prosperion
==========

This project was completed using a ruby on rails framework. However, that standard is deviated from in several key areas.

1) The goals, presets, and clients pages rely heavily on javascript incuded in the corresponding view file to allow for the coexistance of forms and indexes on the same page

2) In order to allow the rails project to run well on windows it is wrapped with python

3) Most of the timeline page can be found on visit_snapshot.

Changing the visualization

- All html pages are of type html.erb it is standard html just with ruby imbeded in it
- There is a secondary css page for print
- In order to edit the html look under app/views
- In order to edit the css look under app/assets/stylesheets
- In order to change out images look under app/assets/images

General Visual Architecture

-The data entry page for client is based on the client show
-The data entry page for visits is based on the visit show
-The data entry page for disclaimer and goal category types is on the presets index
-The timeline page is on the visits index
-The goal graph page is on goal show
-The page with multiple goals is on goal index

Finding Ruby on Rails Contractors

There are a lot of contracting shops in the area Pivotal Labs is probably the best known and probably has the best reputation but probably not the best cost. The same is true with most of the big contracting firms in the area. They are good but have more overhead and hence higer cost. The most affordable way to get more done would be to hire an independant contractor. Mark Nerry is in the area and does contracting I have worked with him and he has a Linkedin you can find him by. Your absolute cheapest would be to find someone just getting started with contracting on oDesk.com through that you even have the option of ofshoring development. 

Hopefully that helps.
